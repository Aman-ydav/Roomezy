**Roomezy** is a modern, fast, and trustworthy platform designed to help students and working professionals find rooms, PGs (Paying Guest accommodations), hostels, and flatmates with ease. Built with a focus on user experience, Roomezy offers verified listings, real-time chat, photo-based feeds, and seamless interactions to make finding the perfect living space simple and secure.

## 🎯 Our Mission & Vision

### The Problem We Solve
It all started in college WhatsApp groups — endless messages like 'Need a room near campus' or 'Looking for a roommate who doesn't smoke.' The chaos, the confusion, the uncertainty… something had to change. Traditional rental platforms were impersonal, expensive, and lacked the human touch needed for shared living decisions.

### Our Vision
We wanted Roomezy to be more than a listing app — a trusted space where people could match based on habits, lifestyle, and comfort. A platform that values people, not just properties. Where safety, clarity, and community come first.

### The Solution
Every feature — from filters to chat to verification — was built based on real user problems. Roomezy was shaped by community stories and powered by modern web technologies. From beta feedback to real users finding their roommates — Roomezy grew into a community. A place where safety, clarity, and comfort lead the experience.

### Our Core Values
- **Trust First**: Verified listings and transparent communication
- **Community Driven**: Built by users, for users
- **Safety Focused**: Prioritizing secure interactions and background checks
- **Inclusive**: Welcoming all lifestyles and preferences
- **Innovation**: Leveraging technology to solve real-world problems

### Impact & Growth
Roomezy represents the evolution of roommate finding — from chaotic group chats to a structured, safe, and efficient platform. We've helped thousands connect with compatible roommates and find their perfect living spaces, creating lasting friendships and communities along the way.

## 📋 How It Works

### Understanding Post Types
Roomezy uses three simple post types to help you find exactly what you're looking for:

1. **"Room Available" Posts** (🏠):
   - Posted by owners who have a room to rent or roommates seeking someone to share their space.
   - These are direct room listings with details like rent, location, photos, and amenities.
   - Perfect for finding actual available rooms.

2. **"Looking for Roommate" Posts** (👥):
   - Posted by people who already have a room and want someone to share rent with.
   - Great for budget-friendly options and building instant connections.
   - These posts help you join existing shared living arrangements.

3. **"Looking for Room" Posts** (👤):
   - Posted by room seekers who need accommodation.
   - Owners and roommate-seekers can contact them if they have availability.
   - These posts do NOT list rooms — they're for finding potential roommates or tenants.

### Getting Started Guide

#### For Room Seekers:
1. **Create Your Account**: Sign up with email, add your details, and multiple locations for flexible searching.
2. **Browse Posts**: Use filters to find "Room Available" or "Looking for Roommate" posts that match your preferences.
3. **Connect Safely**: Reach out politely, ask important questions, and schedule viewings.
4. **Verify Details**: Always meet in public places and trust your instincts.

#### For Room Owners/Roommates:
1. **List Your Space**: Choose the right post type and provide accurate details.
2. **Add Quality Photos**: High-quality images increase response rates significantly.
3. **Be Transparent**: Include all costs, rules, and preferences upfront.
4. **Screen Applicants**: Ask relevant questions and meet potential roommates in person.

### Account Management
- **Dashboard**: Manage all your posts, edit details, toggle visibility, and track interactions.
- **Profile Settings**: Update personal info, add multiple locations, and set preferences.
- **Post Status**: Toggle posts between active, archived, or hidden as needed.
- **Privacy Controls**: Control what information is visible to other users.

### Safety & Best Practices
- **Verify Information**: Always cross-check details provided by other users.
- **Meet in Public**: Schedule initial meetings in safe, public locations.
- **Trust Your Judgment**: If something feels off, don't proceed.
- **Report Issues**: Use our reporting system for suspicious activity.
- **Secure Communication**: Use our platform's messaging for initial contact.
